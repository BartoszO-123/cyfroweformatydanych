Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".

He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In his later years, he focused on a unified field theory, although he was not successful in this endeavor before his death.
